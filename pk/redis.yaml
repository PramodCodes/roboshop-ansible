#A GPG check is a method used to verify the integrity and authenticity of software packages,
#  especially in Linux environments. It uses GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) to ensure that the software package
#  has not been tampered with and comes from a trusted source.
#Here's a simplified breakdown of how it works:
#Public and Private Keys: GPG uses a pair of keys â€“ a public key and a private key. The software package
#  is signed with the private key, and the signature is verified using the public key3.
#Verification Process: When you download a package, you can use GPG to verify the signature against
#  the package. If the signature matches, it means the package is authentic and hasn't been altered3.
#Security: This process helps maintain a high level of security by ensuring that only verified
#  and authentic software is installed on your system.
